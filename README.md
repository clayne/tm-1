This library provides an easy way to set timers, timeouts. 
As initial version all timers are run in single runloop at seperate thread. 
In the future multiple runloop may be allowed. 

#### Why? 

It has been born because a timer and timeline utils were needed in a render engine called [Graphics Kernel](https://github.com/recp/gk) for animations and other things. 
It seems very good in first release, in the future it may provide other features.

#### Documentation

Currently all docs can be found in headers but in the future complete docs will be published. 

#### Javascript and Swift/Objective-C like API

`setTimeout` in javascript is very useful and it is now in `C`:

```C
tm_settimeout(callback, arg, delay);
```

## Build

### Unix (Autotools)

```bash
$ sh autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ [sudo] make install
```

you can grap library in .libs folder after build finished

### Windows (MSBuild)
Windows related build files, project files are located in `win` folder,
make sure you are inside `tm/win` folder.
Code Analysis are enabled, it may take awhile to build

```Powershell
$ cd win
$ .\build.bat
```

#### Example usage

```C
#include <tm/tm.h>

/* callback */
void
mytimer(tm_timer *timer) {
  printf("my timer\n");
}

void
delayed_func(void *arg) {
  printf("settimeout: %s\n", (const char *)arg);
}

int 
main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
  tm_timer   *timer1, *timer2, *timer3;
  tm_interval start, end, elapsed;
 
  /* option 1: alloc timer and start */
  timer1 = tm_alloc(mytimer, 1.5); /* 1.5 seconds */
  tm_start(timer1);
  
  /* option 2: alloc timer and start with delay */
  timer2 = tm_alloc(mytimer, 1.5); /* 1.5 seconds */
  tm_start_at(timer2, 0.05);       /* start after 0.05 secons */
  
  /* option 3: alloc timer and start with delay */
  timer3 = tm_schedule(mytimer, 1.5, 0.05); /* same as tm_alloc + tm_start_at */
  
  /* option 4: javascript-like setTimeout */
  tm_settimeout(delayed_func, "Hello World!", 0.00001);
  
  /*
  
  if we call free here timers will be stopped 
  
  tm_free(timer1);
  tm_free(timer2);
  tm_free(timer3);

  */
  
  /* measure elapsed time */
  start = tm_time();
  
  /* do stuff */
  
  end = tm_time();
  
  elapsed = end - start;
  
  /* wait timers to finish; otherwise main thread will cause timer thread to be exited */
  tm_wait();

  return 0;
}

```
